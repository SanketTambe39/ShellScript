=================Repetition Practice Problems with while loop========
1. Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints a
table of the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^n till 256 is
reached..
Ans :
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter value for n ::" num

result=1
number=2

i=0

while [[ $i -lt $num && $result -lt 256 ]]
do
        result=$(($result*$number))
        echo $result
        i=$(( i+1 ))
done

2. Find the Magic Number
a. Ask the user to think of a number n between 1 to 100
b. Then check with the user if the number is less then n/2 or greater
c. Repeat till the Magic Number is reached..
Ans:
#!/bin/bash -x
read -p "Enter any number between 1-100" userInputNumber
if [[ $userInputNumber -lt 1 || $userInputNumber -gt 100 ]]
then
	echo "Incorrect input. Run again."
else
	start=1
	end=100
	mid=50
	while [[ $userInputNumber -ne $mid ]]
	do
		echo "Number is greater than or less than " $mid" (use g or l):"
		read pos
		if [ $pos == "g" ]
		then
			start=$mid
			mid=$(( (($start+$end)) / 2))
		else
			end=$mid
			mid=$(( (($start+$end)) / 2 ))
		fi
	done
	echo "Number "$mid" found!"
fi

3. Extend the Flip Coin problem till either Heads or Tails wins 11 times.
Ans :
#!/bin/bash

countH=0
countT=0

while [[ $countH -lt 11 && $countT -lt 11 ]]
do
        flip=$((RANDOM%2))
        if [[ $flip -eq 0 ]]
        then
                countH=$((countH+1))
        else
                countT=$((countT+1))
        fi
done

echo "Head got "$countH" Coins"
echo "Tails got "$countT " Coins "

4. Write a Program where a gambler starts with Rs 100 and places Re 1 bet
until he/she goes broke i.e. no more money to gamble or reaches the
goal of Rs 200. Keeps track of number of times won and number of bets
made.
Ans:
#!/bin/bash

amount=100
win=0
bet=0

while [[ $amount -lt 200 || $amount -eq 0 ]]
do
        spin=$((RANDOM%2))
        bet=$((bet+1))
        if [[ $spin -eq 0 ]]
        then
                amount=$((amount+1))
                win=$((win+1))
        else
                amount=$((amount-1))
        fi
done

echo "So finnally you get "$amount" by "$win "wins in "$bet" bets. "
